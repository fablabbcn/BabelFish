    <h1>BabelFish</h1>
    <p><i>"The Babel fish is small, yellow, leech-like, and probably the
    oddest thing in the universe. It feeds on brain wave energy,
    absorbing all unconscious frequencies and then excreting
    telepathically a matrix formed from the conscious frequencies and
    nerve signals picked up from the speech centres of the brain, the
    practical upshot of which is that if you stick one in your ear,
    you can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of
    language: the speech you hear decodes the brain wave matrix."</i></p>
